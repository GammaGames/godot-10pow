Breakout is a simple breakout clone based on the classic. You can use your mouse to move the paddle, and click to launch the ball. The level is generated with a simple [cellular automata algorithm](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664) for diversity.

The scene consists of 10 nodes:
* A `Main` node
  * This takes care of duplicating bricks and generating the cellular automata grid
* `BaseSprite` and `BaseAudioStream` nodes
  * These are used by the other objects for graphics and sound to keep node count low
* A Paddle node (`KinematicBody2D`)
  * This node creates a duplicate sprite and follows the mouse's `x` position
* A Brick node (`StaticBody2D`)
  * This node can be breakable or unbreakable
  * It will duplicate the necessary sprite and sound nodes
* A Ball node (`RigidBody2D`)
  * This node duplicates the base sprite and sound nodes
  * It has a child `VisibilityNotifier2D` so that it knows when to restart the game

Overall, breakout is a basic game that can fit well in the limitations of the challenge. You can view the folder and project [here](https://github.com/GammaGames/godot-10pow/tree/master/breakout).
