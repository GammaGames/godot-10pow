This is a simple breakout clone based on the classic game. You can use your mouse to move the paddle, and click to launch the ball. The level is generated with a simple [cellular automata algorithm](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664) for variety

The scene consists of 10 nodes:
* A `Main` root
  * This takes care of duplicating bricks and generating the cellular automata grid
* `BaseSprite` and `BaseAudioStream` nodes
  * These are used by the other objects for graphics and sound to keep total node count low
* A Paddle (`KinematicBody2D`)
  * The paddle has a `CollisionBody2D` child
  * This node creates a duplicate sprite and follows the mouse's `x` position
* A Brick (`StaticBody2D`)
  * The brick has a `CollisionBody2D` child
  * This node can be breakable or unbreakable
  * It will duplicate the necessary sprite and sound nodes
* A Ball (`RigidBody2D`)
  * The ball has a `CollisionBody2D` and `VisibilityNotifier2D` children
  * This node duplicates the base sprite and sound nodes
  * It also listens to the `screen_exited` so that it knows when to restart the game

Overall, breakout is a basic game that can fit well in the limitations of the challenge. You can view the project [here](https://github.com/GammaGames/godot-10pow/tree/master/breakout).
