This is a simple [hanenbow](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Hanenbow)-like game based on [Bauxitedev's balldrop project](https://github.com/Bauxitedev/balldrop). You can click and drag to create lines and right a line to delete it. When a ball bounces against a line it will play one of four sounds.

The project uses 226 lines total, with 178 being non-whitespace/comment lines.

The scene consists of 9 nodes:
* A `Main` root
  * This takes care of creating the ball spawners
* `BaseSprite` and `BaseAudioStream` nodes
  * These are used by the other objects for graphics and sound to keep total node count low
* A Line (`StaticBody`)
  * The line has a `CollisionBody2D` child
  * This node creates a duplicate sprite
  * It also has a function for setting its start and end points
* A Ball (`Node2D`)
  * The ball has a `VisibilityNotifier2D` child so it frees itself when necessary
  * This node has a function for setting its sound
  * It also calculates its physics manually and plays its sound when colliding with a line
* A Spawner (`RigidBody2D`)
  * The ball has a `Timer` child so it knows how often to respawn balls
  * This node has a function to set its type and create note pitches

Thank you to Bauxitedev for putting his balldrop code on [github](https://github.com/Bauxitedev/balldrop)! You can view the project [here](https://github.com/GammaGames/godot-10pow/tree/master/hanenbow) or played in the browser [here](/assets/export/hanenbow/index.html).
