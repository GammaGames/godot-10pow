10<sup>pow</sup> is a simple challenge that aims to limit your resources and enhance creative solutions to make small games in the Godot engine.  
The name comes from the limitations set in place:

* 1 (10<sup>0</sup>) scene
* 10 (10<sup>1</sup>) nodes and scripts
* 100 (10<sup>2</sup>) loc/script
* 1000 (10<sup>3</sup>) KB max
